# School Project Not_Space_Invaders
 A game that's a lot like Space Invaders but it's made for a school project, so it's also probably not as good
 
# Executable
It's the "NOT Space Invaders.zip" file

# TODO:
1. add darker hearts for health, where there are none
2. Pickups -> change \[ ? ] to something else, like the picture of a bullet
3. rename the game to "Definitely NOT Space Invaders" <br>
~~4. add labels for F5 and F10 functionalities on the bottom left of the screen~~
5. change points label to be on just at the bottom of the Player name label
6. add some kind of animation to the health pickup
7. make automated scaling for different resolutions

Also, turn in all the videos that correspond with the whole game design

## Until: April 6th, 2022
